# odin-recipes
This Odin Project website is very basic. It is a website that consists of an index page with links to three recipes. Due to the project not requiring CSS (for now), it's not very pretty. 
This project is intended to showcase my knowledge on how to make lists (unordered and ordered), link other .html files to the main index page, how to display image tags and headings properly, and to memorize the boilerplate. Essentially, everything I have learned up to this first project.

I have included some tags that The Odin Project has not taught yet within the html files. I am not completely new to this, since I have already been learning HTML/CSS/JS - just not at the same scope as The Odin Project.
